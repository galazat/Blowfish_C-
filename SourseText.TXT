Cryptography at its very core is math. Pure, simple, undiluted math. Math created the algorithms that are the basis for all encryption. And encryption is the basis for privacy and security on the internet. So, we love math. Even if it is a tad complicated. With that being said, algorithms have to be built to work against computers. As computers get smarter, algorithms become weaker and we must therefore look at new solutions. This is how cryptography evolves to beat the bad guys.
